# Data folder
- Canonical public CaRMS extracts live here: `1503_program_master.xlsx`, `1503_discipline.xlsx`, and the description sections CSV.
- The zipped source bundles were removed from repo root on 2026-02-12 to keep the package light; these folders hold the extracted copies used by code and notebooks.
- Pipelines auto-discover files under `data/`, so no path changes are needed.
